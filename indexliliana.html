    <h2>backstory</h2>
    <p>
        Liliana grew up in the capital building in the city her parents ruled over the city and the neighborhoods outside together. 
        When she was little anyone was free to go anywhere they pleased. Her parents were also scientists who experimented with creating new life forms.
        They were so close to creating a new type of animal that would have all the nutrients a person needed and since it was made in a lab they wouldnâ€™t run out.
        The towns around them were very poor and people struggled to get food so this would be the perfect solution. 
        The only problem was that it carried a deadly disease that killed people slowly and painfully that travelled easily. 
        They kept the animal in the lab running test after test but one day when lily was three it broke out of the lab and ran out of the city. Her father caught the disease and died. 
        He was the first one taken by the disease in the months since they found out about it Her mother quickly closed off the city to the rest of the world.
        she watched as the rest of the world suffered from this disease. 
        She was trying to find a cure but they are still very far from one. Lily grew up very sheltered because of her mothers paranoia, and her brother was jaded and wanted to just kill everyone outside of the city. She is frustrated by the fact that she never gets to leave the capitol building let alone the city so one day she sneaks out and that is where the story starts.
