     <h2 style="color: white; text-align: left;" id="book one">book one</h2>
            <p style="color: white; text-align: left;" id="book one plot">the world went through a pandemic caused by a failed experiment done by scientist and father of Lilliana, Dylan Anders in the city of angels (just a stand in name) 
        that got loose outside of the city that killed him and most of the population 90% of which came from poorer neighborhoods as they couldn’t get treatment. 
   Now the elite and rich are hiding out in a city keeping out the suffering people. Liliana grew up in the city of angels and is one of the richest people in the city.
   Aera grew up in one of the poorest neighborhoods left and Evangeline grew up with enough to get by but not nearly as much as lily her parents both died of the due to an attack by the city.
   At the beginning of the first book a curious lily decides to exit the city to see what lies outside of her small world. 
   She finds a group of people who are trying to break into the city but before she can find out what's happening she is attacked by the residents and is hit in the head causing her to forget all the research she did to keep people out of the city and tries to help the group as best she can. 
   It’s primarily just her getting to know the people at camp. She finds out that Aera  and Ginny (Evangeline) have been dating and we get their backstories.
   She slowly gains her memories back and works hard to undo the damage she caused. In the first book a small battle happens between the kids at the camp and some soldiers patrolling the forest  ending in Sophie's death.
    One of the soldiers sees Lily and quickly gets back to the city to inform her mum of her whereabouts.</p>
    <h2 style="color: white; text-align: right;" id="book two"> Book two</h2>
        <p style="text-align: right;" id="book two plot"> after Lily has all of her memories back and is fully on the side of the resistance group she becomes a kind of leader. It starts at the camp filled with adults that we find out the kids ran to after the fight with the soldiers.
            They all take turns going to the walls of the city trying to find a way they can all get in with all their fire power but discreetly. In one of her rounds Veronica is kidnapped by the guards on the outskirts of the city and is held hostage to trade for Lily who her mother believes has been kidnaped by the resistance after the guard saw her in the fight from book one.
            She is also being tortured to give away the whereabouts of the camp. There's a small attempt to get her back ending in the death of Aeras' father.

        <p id="book three plot" style="text-align: left;">a rescue mission to get Veronica back and also get people into the city and into the capitol building to take down Liliana's mother and brother.   But some people in the resistance group get drunk with power and tear the city to the ground killing many people on both sides.
            The story  ends with the breaking down of borders and the world being as peaceful as it can with most of the elite gone and the poorer civilization building a life for themselves with what's left...
