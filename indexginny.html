    <h2>backstory</h2>
        <p>when she was fifteen both her parents were killed by an attack on civilians who were too close to the city walls.
            they ran into the woods and stumbled upon a camp full of other teenagers.
            One of which was Aera the only girl near her age there was two other girls one who seemed to be two years older then Ginny was standing next to a girl who couldn’t be more than ten. 
            they're  scared but the group seems to be friendly. She passes out for exhaustion as she starts to make her way into camp and wakes up a few hours later in a makeshift hospital room.
            A few boys who they guessed were they're “doctors” were sitting at the other side of the room seemingly waiting for them to wake up. After about a day of recovery from her hit on the head when she passed out she was ready to be integrated into the group. 
            they take the job of helping Aera out with her second in command duties. They become friends quickly and after a couple of months they start dating. She gets into a fight with a random character that doesn’t matter to the plot and he calls them useless because she doesn’t have a job for herself and she just helps Aera and accuses Aera of playing favourites. 
            they really takes the word useless to heart as she was already struggling with her sense of self worth. Later that day after the word useless fills her head for hours they run into the woods and towards the wall to the city. 
            She didn’t deserve to get to the city. they were useless and horrible and just barged into the camp and took the third most important role where she does nothing. They don't need her.
            No one needs them so she climbs up the vines on the side of the wall and jumps off hoping it was the last thing they'd ever do. She fails though and after that Aera never lets them out of her sight.
            She feels weird about Aera's constant surveillance as they feels Aera could be spending her time doing other things but she knows she won’t be able to change Aera's mind. 
            After a while they don’t really mind Aera being around all the time she is her girlfriend after all. She still has bad days but they are far outnumbered by the good ones.
