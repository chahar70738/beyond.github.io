    <h2>backstory</h2>
    <p>
        Aera's backstory: Aera grew up in the poorest area left on the planet. It was about ten miles outside of the city. 
        Her mom died of the virus when she was 4, and her dad and older brother have been fighting to get into the city ever since. 
        She joined the resistance group trying to enter the city at 14 four years before the events of the story. 
        One year after she joined the group another kid named Evangeline, who insisted everyone call her Ginny, showed up at the base. 
        They became close friends very quickly as there were few feminan presenting people in the group. females were more susceptible to the virus so there werenâ€™t many left outside the city walls.
        After about six months of getting to know each other they were both 16 and they started dating. About two and a half years before another girl their age would show up at camp. 
        She always felt trapped at the base as there was a wall to one side of them and woods that went on for miles on all other sides. 
        During her time as part of the group before Ginny arrived Aera grew very stubborn and closed herself off to most of the people in the group.
        Ginny was the first person to really let her be herself and just relax at times which made it all the more painful when Ginny tried to take her own life.
        After the attempt Aera never let Ginny out of her sight which continued to be the norm until a stranger entered camp from inside the city.
        Her older brother is 3 years older and he looks after all the kids.
