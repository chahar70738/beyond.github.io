    <h2>backstory</h2>
    <p>veronica quickly clicked with Min-jun as they were only a year apart in age and when they were fifteen and sixteen they started dating.
       Veronica is angry that her parents havenâ€™t visited since they joined the resistance. 
       She took on a motherly role after the older kids joined the adults and a few other kids joined the group. 
       her and sophie have grown so close without their parents that Sophie almost views Veronica as more of a mother than there own mother.
